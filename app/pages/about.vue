    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <p>
      Lifegate Baptist Church is an evangelical Bible-centered group of believers. Our current focus is feeding the
      saints
      through weekly worship services, providing for our missionaries through strong financial support and prayer, and
      providing social support to our members through fellowship and prayer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lifegate, located in rural Eau Claire, MI, has a membership of approximately 40 individuals from various
      backgrounds. This includes many elderly members, families, homeschoolers, couples, and single adults. Our members
      engage in church activities, socializing and supporting one another inside and outside the church. Our weekly
      services are characterized by Bible preaching, monthly communion, and singing traditional hymns. We are a friendly
      church with the gift of hospitality. Our joyful spirit compels us to welcome anyone who wants to hear the Gospel
      message and join us in worship.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>

    <p>
      Lifegate is committed to ensuring that Godâ€™s Word is preached in our church for generations to come. We will
      continue to support missions and maintain our friendly and welcoming spirit. Our vision for the future includes
      growing our membership, expanding our outward evangelism, exploring community outreach and service, making
      improvements to our physical space and accessibility, offering additional services/small groups, and developing
      engaging programming for our teens and young adults.
    </p>

    <h2>Whom We Are Seeking</h2>

    <p>
      Our former pastor of over 20 years passed away in 2019. Since then, Lifegate has sat under two interim pastors
      provided by IMI/SOS while we seek a permanent pastor.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are seeking a pastor who is committed to preaching the Inerrant Word of God. This commitment includes pastoral
      duties such as preaching for adult Sunday School and Sunday service, possibly adding a Wednesday night or Sunday
      night service. Other pastoral responsibilities may consist of counseling, visitation, officiating weddings,
      providing funeral services, overseeing baptisms, and related pastoral duties. Currently, we are able to offer a
      part-time salary. As such, we are seeking a bi-vocational pastor.
    </p>

    <p>
      We welcome leadership and feel that our new pastor should have room to develop programs based on his callings,
      interests, and passions while guiding our present and future ministry within the scope of our church vision.
